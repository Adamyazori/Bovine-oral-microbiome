# Bovine-oral-microbiome
This repository contains codes, supplementary material and other datasets for our manuscript that investigates the early development of the bovine oral and rumen microbiota and compares whether the oral microbiota community could be used as a proxy of the rumen. In addition, we determine the possibility to use oral community for prediction.
